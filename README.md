# CAM Database Server

## Description

This project requires building a full-stack web application to normalize and display GSA property data, featuring a relational database, data wrangling for building names, deployment with CI/CD, and a four-page frontend including a filterable building table, an interactive map with Google Maps API street-level views, and two distinct dashboards for owned and leased properties with various data visualizations and charts.

You will need to run the Client side at the same time to make the code fully work. [Here is the link](https://github.com/juliorojas81871/cam_client)

**Note: This service is hosted on Render's free tier, which may introduce cold starts after periods of inactivity. When a cold start occurs, the server instance needs to spin up, which can take 60â€“120 seconds before it's ready to handle requests. You may experience a temporary delay during this initialization phase.**

## Technologies & Methods Used

**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
**Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (type-safe database operations)
**Data Processing:** XLSX for Excel file parsing, custom data cleansing algorithms
**Testing:** Jest with comprehensive test suite and coverage reporting
**Deployment:** Render.com with automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions
**API:** RESTful endpoints with CORS support

**Custom Data Processing Workflows:**
* Excel data import and validation
* Building name cleaning and address parsing  
* Date conversion from Excel serial format
* Duplicate detection and management
* Smart data separation (owned vs leased properties)

## Steps to get code to run:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/juliorojas81871/cam_server.git
cd server
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
Create a `.env` file:
```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=cam_database
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
PORT=3001
```

4. **Set up PostgreSQL database:**
Make sure PostgreSQL is running, then:
```bash
npm run db:setup
```

5. **Import data (if you have Excel files):**
```bash
npm run import
```

6. **Start the development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

7. **Test the API endpoints:**
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Get owned properties
curl http://localhost:3000/api/owned

# Get leases
curl http://localhost:3000/api/leases
```

## API Endpoints:

* `GET /health` - Server health check
* `GET /api/owned` - Retrieve all federally owned properties
* `GET /api/leases` - Retrieve all lease records


## Testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```
